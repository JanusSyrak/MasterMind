READY
Help is not currently implemented
Exception handling for input
Give an error when entering incorrect code length / rounds / colors
There is no consistency between pegs and colors. Which is it?
Perhaps make mainLoop static so we can call it directly
Change handleInput to switch statement
Make GAME state in GameController much simpler
GAME state is fundamentally different from all of the other states
Confirm whether to reset the game
It is weird to check for both the current state and the state transition, which is what we are currently doing in the GameController. 
Give a warning when changing the settings while playing a game
There is no consistency whether naming in .h-files or not
Confirmation does not belong in InputController. This is a separate state
Introduce the possibility of resetting game while playing
Stop game while playing
Remove redundant #include
executeState() should be delegated to the States themselves


TERMINATED
Operator overload board <<
Possibility of having blanks?
Implement Prompt class
Create an enum for the game states
Implement Output class
Handle more than 10 different colors (probably redundant)

STARTED
Go to MainMenu from game
Reset while playing a game
Settings while playing game

FINISHED
Does not break when ending game
Add possibility of exiting game
Magic numbers in InputController when switching for pegs
GameController has too many responsibilities
Implement StateManager
Move all state handling to StateManager
Enable changing of number of colors and code length in Settings
Implement a StateStack
Confirmation when changing settings
Perform a smarter switch of SETTINGS in InputController
Duplication when confirming choice in InputController
Board does not print correctly when changing code length
Board size not correct when changing number of rounds
Make a possibility of implementing changing of rounds
Error when displaying "Guess must be of length x"
Implement inputHandler
Break when you don't want to play anymore
Create a GameSettings class
You need to enter something when you lose a game
InputController returns a state, which doesn't really make sense.
Move the logic of the different states except GAME into the GraphicsController
Implement a Code class
move displayMainScreen to GraphicsController
while (!(game.valid_guess(current_guess))) { to InputHandler
Fix underscores
MainLoop is a monstrosity
Code should not be displayed when starting new game
Pegs doesn't correctly update
Print board when losing
Duplicate code when finishing game with either win or loss
Magic number in compare guess
printBoard when code is guessed (OOP first)
Change the board height after changing number of rounds
Give GameController GameState
Game reset
Move displayWelcomeScreen to MasterMindView
Code doesn't reset when resetting game
Exception/prompt when input doesn't match
Shuffle not working properly
Rand is not rand
Add possibility for more colors
Add possibility for more code lengths
Game class?
OOP
Why is Code not just vector?
Not enough guesses (fx guess is "5")
Check correct number of rounds
break when replying no
Magic numbers (some left in codegenerator())
MasterMindView(er)
Create introduction screen explaining the different allowed inputs
Game possibility for more rounds
main menu
Refactor the main game loop
Welcome screen

PAUSED
InputChecker

Create enumerate for game state
